# ClassicalGuitarNeckModeling

## Organization

The repository is organized into folders representing different guitar models, each identified by its scale length measurement. Within each folder, you will find:

- The COMSOL mph model corresponding to the respective guitar model.
- The associated 3D model.

When working with the models, make sure to re-import them from your local path as necessary.
